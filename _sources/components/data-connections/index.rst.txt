Data Connections
================

Data connections are responsible for extracting data from the source and loading
data into the target.

Currently the supported connections are:

* `CsvConnection <../../package/converter/connector/csv/index.html#converter.connector.csv.CsvConnector>`_
  for connection to csv files on the local machine.

Each connection object has it's own set of configuration options taken from the
systems configuration.
